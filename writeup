I have taken dataset from kaggle.
Till now I had just imported two libraries numpy and pandas. I have installed them by using pip install numpy and pip install pandas.
After that I read dataset by using read_csv() function. By using movies.head() and credits.head() I can see the whole dataset that i had used in this. 
Than I merged credits and movies by taking title as the key. Now we want only those columns that are useful for recommendation. That are genres,id,keywords,
title,overview,cast and crew.After that I found the missing data using isnull() function. After that we imported ast. 
AST stands for Abstract Syntax Tree, which is a potent tool of the Python programming language. It allows us to interact with the Python code itself and can modify it.
ast has ast.literal_eval(text) function in it. We used that function for modification. Then we applied convert function we made using ast to genres, keyword, cast.
So I have completed my backend part. Now I only have to link my frontend and backend and my project will be completed.
 Thank You
