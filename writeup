I have taken dataset from kaggle.
Till now I had just imported two libraries numpy and pandas. I have installed them by using pip install numpy and pip install pandas.
After that I read dataset by using read_csv() function. By using movies.head() and credits.head() I can see the whole dataset that i had used in this. 
Than I merged credits and movies by taking title as the key.
That all I had done till now.
 
 Thank You
